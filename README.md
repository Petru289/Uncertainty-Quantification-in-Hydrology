# Uq In Hydrology

- sobol2.py contains the algorithm from the book, is slightly different. I have to fix plots, an update should come. Better results, but still not perfect...

- To get the histogramm as well as the sensitivity analysis run main.py
- If you just want either one of them run the specific file.
